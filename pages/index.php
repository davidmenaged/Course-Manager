                <h6>About</h6>
                <p class="text-justify">The end of a semester is easily the most stressful time of year for students.
                    Not only do they have to deal with the pressure of finals, but it’s also the time to register for
                    classes for the upcoming semester. Students are often overwhelmed at the prospect of choosing
                    classes for the upcoming semester, given that, in most cases, the courses for which they need to
                    register are courses they have never experienced prior, and they therefore are clueless as to which
                    classes are best for them. Advisors are able to help somewhat, but the stress level remains much
                    greater than it needs to be. Students need a program that allows them to quickly and knowledgeably
                    choose classes for the upcoming semester, and be confident that they are set up for success.
                    Another, related issue that arises is the difficulty for advisors to properly advise students on the
                    best classes for each student. Advisors have many important issues that require their attention, and
                    helping students choose classes for the upcoming semester often cannot be a priority for them. It’s
                    very difficult for advisors to properly assist students and set them up for a successful college
                    career. Our solution to the problem is a web-based program that will provide students with the
                    information they need to choose classes for the upcoming semester.
